Cat and Dog Prediction Using CNN
Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. 
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images to distinguish between cat and dog images with high accuracy.

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.11
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Steps to Install
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Jadhavsakshi7887/Projects/blob/main/CAT_VS_DOG.ipynb
Navigate to the project directory:
cd cat-dog-prediction
Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Training the Model
To train the CNN model, run the following command:
python train_model.py
This script will load the dataset, train the model, and save the trained model to a file.
Making Predictions
To classify a new image as either a cat or a dog, use the following command:
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
Replace path/to/image.jpg with the path to the image you want to classify.
Features
Model Training: Trains a CNN model with the provided dataset.
Image Classification: Classifies new images as either cat or dog using the trained model.
Code Structure
train_model.py: Script for training the CNN model.
predict.py: Script for making predictions on new images.
model.py: Contains the CNN architecture and model definition.
data/: Directory containing training and test datasets.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required to run the project.
