# ðŸ˜ƒ Emotion Detection using CNN

## **Overview**
This project is an **Emotion Detection model** built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The model classifies emotions in images of faces into different categories such as **happy, sad, angry**, etc.  
It is designed to be used for various applications including **sentiment analysis**, **human-computer interaction**, and more.

# Trained on Google Colab

This model was trained using Google Colab, leveraging its free GPU/TPU resources for faster computation
