Emotion Detection using CNN
Overview
This project is an Emotion Detection model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
The model classifies emotions in images of faces into different categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc. 
It is designed to be used for various applications including sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and more.

Features
Emotion Classification: Detects and classifies emotions from facial images.
Pre-trained Model: Model trained on a dataset of facial expressions.
High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in classifying different emotions.
Installation
To use this project, you need to have Python 3.11 and the necessary libraries installed. 
You can set up the environment using the following steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Jadhavsakshi7887/emotion-detection-cnn.git
cd emotion-detection-cnn
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  
Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load the Model:

from keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('emotion_detection_model.h5')
Prepare the Input Image:

from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input
import numpy as np

#prepare input images
def prepare_image(img_path):
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(48, 48), grayscale=True)
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)
    return img_array
